      <p class="lead text-justify" id="overview1">OVERVIEW:</p>
      <p class="lead text-justify">Builder is a web and phone application that helps you reach your end goal by
        <mark>visualizing</mark> it.
        It is inspired by Forest and Flora on the IOS Appstore. The app provides incentives and deterrents that motivate
        you to <mark>develop good habits,
          easily focus and reflect on your work/progress. </mark></p>
      <p class="lead text-justify" id="motivation1">MOTIVATION:</p>
      <p class="lead text-justify">Many students, including myself, procrastinate heavily. It is prevalent and abundant
        in today’s society that is full of mobile phones, social media and technology. ‘The Nature of Procrastination,’
        a study by Steel Piers concluded that 80 to 95 percent of college students engage in procrastination, and almost
        50 percent procrastinate consistently and problematically (Piers, 2007). The likely reason students
        procrastinate in the first place falls under different categories; indecision, the fear of failure, the
        confusion whether they were doing an assignment right, or the approach during the first steps of an assignment
        (Price, 2018). Perhaps building an app that incentivizes your peers and yourself as well as helping transform
        students to have a laser-focused determination is just the thing we need to <mark>consistently combat
          procrastination.</mark>
      </p>
      <p class="lead text-justify" id="description1">DESCRIPTION:</p>
      <p class="lead text-justify">Builder is a web and phone application that helps you achieve your goals by
        <mark>visualizing</mark> it. An empty virtual world is created when you first launch the app. The app is
        intuitive and
        straightforward to use. A goal is equivalent to a city. You’d want to split the goal into as many steps and
        objectives as you wish. This step makes it less overwhelming and gives the user a plan of attack. The user can
        see their progress visually as they tick off their completed tasks and see their <mark>beautiful procedural
          generated
          architecture</mark> being built as a result of their hard work. Users can activate ‘focus-mode’ during their
        tasks at
        any time. This is for the user to get the ball rolling to induce and trigger the phenomenon known as the flow
        state (the mental state of being fully immersed and energized focus). Focus-mode means that at any time they log
        on their phone and switch to another app or blacklisted website, the Builder app will detect it and destroy
        their building. This is then recorded forever in your world history and gives the user to reflect on their
        actions, giving them <mark>deterrence and accountability.</mark> As the user accumulates their goals, a whole
        world will be
        built for the user to explore freely. Navigating the world brings up the steps the user took and see every
        little detail to achieve it from start to finish.
      </p>
      <p class="lead text-justify">Another feature that Builder has is a <mark>simple habit tracker</mark>. Each
        successful day
        allows you to acquire little buildings and trees that contribute to your virtual world. There would be
        milestones that can equate to skyscrapers or monuments.</p>
      <p class="lead text-justify">The Builder can also be used for group projects. Teammates would work on the same
        world, building skyscrapers, monuments, and infrastructure. Users can either place rewards such as money, coins
        etc. to achieve their goals together or activate focus-mode. When a teammate decides to get distracted, their
        structure will be demolished, causing a domino effect in their world, destroying everyone’s buildings. Giving
        students accountability encourages them to do their work, increasing productivity. Allowing the students to
        approach the tasks in a different perspective might be the only thing that is holding them back from doing the
        work instead of procrastinating.</p>
      <p class="lead text-justify">The user has the option to share their progress with others, like the journey it took
        to complete it as well as cheering your friends through gifts and tokens. You can also share whoever destroyed
        their building, set trackers and to-do list reminders, and stop yourself from phone addiction by limiting phone
        usage. </p>
      <p class="lead text-justify">The app must be free or cost $1-2 to purchase. The app will be funded by investors
        and gain customers through advertisements, word of mouth or organically through both the IOS App or Android Play
        store.</p>
      <p class="lead text-justify" id="tools1">TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES:</p>
      <p class="lead text-justify">You would need to develop the software using Xcode, Javascript and Android SDK and
        have an IOS, android compatible device to test and debug the software. However, it is possible to launch the
        application via HTML, CSS and Javascript and make it phone compatible. </p>
      <p class="lead text-justify">For the backend, you would need to have a database capable of storing all user
        activity from app usage to UI navigation to refine the product.</p>
      <p class="lead text-justify">It is essential to have fantastic graphics, procedurally generated architecture and
        algorithms to be smooth, effective and efficient. It must provoke the user to be emotionally attached to the
        structures that were built by them. It must have soothing sound effects and relaxing music. It is also important
        as the structures are getting built or explored that it is immersive and breathtaking. Applications such as
        Monument Valley, a dark room or Alto’s adventure are huge inspirations of what the app should feel, look and
        sound like. </p>
      <p class="lead text-justify" id="skills1">SKILLS REQUIRED:</p>
      <p class="lead text-justify">You will need to have a solid foundation of coding before you can start this project.
        You need to be proficient in javascript and swift. I think it is crucial that you find motivation first and that
        you believe in the product wholeheartedly. The consistent practice and learning of javascript and swift, with
        the use of the resources found online, will aid in the journey of developing the app. </p>
      <p class="lead text-justify" id="outcomes1">OUTCOMES:</p>
      <p class="lead text-justify">If the project is successful and complete, I will feel accomplished in the sense that
        I have completed a milestone I’ve always had. Because of the app, more people will have the motivation to study
        and have more resources to combat procrastination as well as build good or remove bad habits. From a business
        standpoint, it will provide me some entrepreneur status and add an excellent addition to my portfolio. </p>
      <p class="lead text-justify">The problem initially is that procrastination is a functioning problem of society
        that everyone experiences. It cannot be 100% solved. However, by providing an app that continually supports,
        motivates, and pairs you up with peers, as well as an app that students actively use and reflect on visually,
        will certainly help students in some regard. </p>
